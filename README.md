# Bike-Rental-Prediction---OLS
In this project, we are trying to predict daily bike rentals using linear regression model. The dataset contains daily bike rentals, seasonal and weather indicators in 2011 and 2012. We'll perform Exploratory Data Analysis to explore the distribution of bike rentals and the relationships between season &amp; weather indicators. Then, we'll generate a heatmap to discover the most influential factors that affects daily bike rentals and build several linear regression models on those influential factors. We'll also evaluate each model based on R-squared value.
